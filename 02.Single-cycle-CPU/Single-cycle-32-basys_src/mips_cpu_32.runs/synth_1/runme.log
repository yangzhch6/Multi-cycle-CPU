These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/Top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/Top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (dataSelect_321/out_reg[0]) is unused and will be removed from module Top.
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (pc/o_pc_reg[0]) is unused and will be removed from module Top.
INFO: [Synth 8-4480] The timing for the instance pc/o_pc_reg_rep (implemented as a block RAM) might be sub-optimal as no optional output register could be merged into the block ram. Providing additional output register may help in improving timing.
